            <p>Nature photography is a wide range of photography taken outdoors and devoted to displaying natural elements such as landscapes, wildlife, plants, and close-ups of natural scenes and textures. Nature photography tends to put a stronger emphasis on the aesthetic value of the photo than other photography genres, such as photojournalism and documentary photography. [1]
            "Nature photography" overlaps the fields ofâ€”and is sometimes considered an overarching category including -- "wildlife photography," "landscape   photography," and "garden photography".[1] </p>

              Nature photographs are published in scientific, travel and cultural magazines such as National Geographic Magazine, National Wildlife Magazine and Audubon Magazine or other more specific magazines such as Outdoor Photographer and Nature's Best Photography. As such, landscape photography is an adjacent rather than a sub-category of nature photography.

              Landscape photography is one of the categories of photography often associated with nature photography. It focuses on images of the natural world (such as rivers, mountains, deserts, and forests) [2] as well as man-made structures (such as city skylines). However, that is rarer and separated from nature photography. As such, landscape photography is an adjacent rather than a sub-category of nature photography.
